# Polynomial Solver

A simple solver for basic operations on polynomials.

The solver rewrites the user's polynomial and simplifies it.
If the polynomial is in an equation, it will be solved. If, instead, he wants the solution of a specific operation (i.e. to find the roots or the delta), it will be easy as to give the command of that specific operation in input to the terminal.
The software does not have a graphical interface, it works only from terminal.

<sub>Technologies: F#, Visual Studio</sub>
